# Custom Low Level Discovery

Zabbix's Low-Level Discovery (LLD) plays a crucial role in dynamically detecting
and managing monitored entities. While Zabbix provides built-in discovery rules,
real-world environments often demand more flexibility and customization.

In this chapter, we will explore custom LLD techniques, allowing you to create powerful,
tailored discovery mechanisms that go beyond standard templates. You'll learn how
to use scripts and custom rules to automatically detect and monitor services,
network interfaces, and other dynamic components within your infrastructure.

Whether you're monitoring cloud environments, network devices, or application-specific
metrics, mastering custom LLD will help you reduce manual work, improve accuracy,
and scale your monitoring effortlessly. Let’s dive in!


???+ note 
    For this chapter we start with a working system with a proper configured agent
    in passive mode. If you have no clue how to do this go back to chapter 01.

Zabbix **Low-Level Discovery** (LLD) provides a dynamic mechanism for automatically
creating monitoring elements based on discovered entities within your infrastructure.

**Core Functionality :**

LLD enables Zabbix to detect changes in your environment and create corresponding
items, triggers, and graphs without manual intervention. This automation is particularly
valuable when monitoring elements with fluctuating quantities or identifiers.

**Discovery Targets:**
The discovery process can identify and monitor various system components including:

- File systems
- CPUs
- CPU cores
- Network interfaces
- SNMP OIDs
- JMX objects
- Windows services
- Systemd services
- Host interfaces
- Anything based on custom scripts

Through LLD, administrators can implement scalable monitoring solutions that automatically
adapt to infrastructure changes without requiring constant template modifications.

## Implementing Low-Level Discovery in Zabbix

### The Challenge of Manual Configuration

We could manually create each item but this would be a very time-consuming task
and impossible to manage in large environments. To enable automatic discovery of
our items or entities, we need discovery rules.

### Discovery Rules

These rules send the necessary data to Zabbix for our discovery process. There 
is no limit to the various methods we can employ, the only requirement is that
the end result must be formatted in JSON. This output information is crucial as
it forms the foundation for creating our items.

### Prototypes and Automation

Once our discovery rule is in place, we can instruct Zabbix to automatically generate
items, triggers, graphs, and even host prototypes. These function as blueprints
directing Zabbix how to create those entities.

### LLD Macros

To enhance flexibility, Zabbix implements LLD macros. These macros always begin
with a # character before their name (e.g., {#FSNAME}). Acting as placeholders for
the values of discovered entities, Zabbix replaces these macros with the actual
discovered names of the items during the implementation process.

### The Zabbix Low-Level Discovery Workflow

The workflow that Zabbix follows during Low-Level Discovery consists of four
distinct phases:

**Discovery Phase**
* Zabbix executes the discovery item according to the defined discovery rule
* The item returns a JSON list of discovered entities

**Processing Phase**
* Zabbix parses the JSON data and extracts the necessary information

**Creation Phase**
* For each discovered entity, Zabbix creates items, triggers, and graphs based on
  the prototypes
* During this process, LLD macros are replaced with the actual discovered values

**Monitoring Phase**
* Zabbix monitors the created items using standard monitoring procedures

### Advantages of LLD Implementation

The benefits of implementing Low-Level Discovery are substantial:

* **Automation** - Creation of items, triggers, graphs, and hosts becomes fully
  automated
* **Scalability** - Enables monitoring of large numbers of hosts or items without
  manual intervention
* **Adaptability** - Zabbix can dynamically adjust to environmental changes by 
  creating or removing entities as needed

## Learning LLD custom script

We begin our series with LLD based on custom scripts because, while it represents
one of the more complex topics, mastering this concept provides a solid foundation.
Once you understand this implementation approach, the other LLD topics will be
considerably easier to comprehend.

Below is a sample JSON structure that Zabbix can interpret for Low-Level Discovery:

!!! info ""
    ``` yaml
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "{#FSNAME}": "/",
          "{#FSTYPE}": "ext4"
        },
        {
          "{#FSNAME}": "/boot",
          "{#FSTYPE}": "ext4"
        },
        {
          "{#FSNAME}": "/data",
          "{#FSTYPE}": "xfs"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
Upon receiving this JSON data, Zabbix processes the discovery information to identify
distinct file systems within the monitored environment. The system extracts and
maps the following elements:

- File system mount points: /, /boot, and /data
- File system types: ext4 and xfs

Zabbix automatically associates these discovered values with their corresponding
LLD macros {#FSNAME} for the mount points and {#FSTYPE} for the file system types.
This mapping enables dynamic creation of monitoring objects tailored to each specific
file system configuration.


### Creating a custom script.

In this example, we will develop a custom script to monitor user login activity on
our systems. This script will track the number of users currently logged into each
monitored host and report their login status.

The implementation requires placing a custom script in the appropriate location on
systems running Zabbix Agent (either version 1 or 2). Create the following script
in the `/usr/bin/` directory on each agent installed system:

!!! info "create our script"
    ``` yaml
    sudo vi /usr/bin/users-discovery.sh
    ```
paste the following content in the file:

!!! info "users-discovery.sh"
    ``` yaml
    #!/bin/bash

    # Find all users with UID ≥ 1000 of UID = 0 from /etc/passwd, except "nobody"
    ALL_USERS=$(awk -F: '($3 >= 1000 || $3 == 0) && $1 != "nobody" {print $1}' /etc/passwd)
    
    # Find all active users
    ACTIVE_USERS=$(who | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq)
    
    # Begin JSON-output
    echo -n '{"data":['
    FIRST=1
    for USER in $ALL_USERS; do
        # Check if the user is active
        if echo "$ACTIVE_USERS" | grep -q "^$USER$"; then
            ACTIVE="yes"
        else
            ACTIVE="no"
        fi
    
        # JSON-format
        if [ $FIRST -eq 0 ]; then echo -n ','; fi
        echo -n "{\"{#USERNAME}\":\"$USER\", \"{#ACTIVE}\":\"$ACTIVE\"}"
        FIRST=0
    done
    echo ']}'
    ```
Once you have created the script don't forget to make it executable.

!!! info ""
    ``` yaml
    sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/users-discovery.sh
    ```
The script will be executed by the Zabbix agent and will return discovery data
about user sessions in the JSON format required for Low-Level Discovery processing.

Once deployed, this script will function as the data collection mechanism for our
user monitoring solution, enabling Zabbix to dynamically discover user sessions
and track login/logout activities across your infrastructure.

**User Provisioning for Testing**

Let's establish additional test user accounts on our system to ensure we have
sufficient data for validating our monitoring implementation. This will provide
a more comprehensive testing environment beyond the default root account and your
personal user account. Feel free to add as many users as you like.

!!! info "create some users"
    ``` yaml
    sudo for user in sven brian cartman kenny; do sudo useradd $user; done
    ```
    Create a password for every user so that we can login on the console
    ``` yaml
    sudo passwd <user>
    ```


### Creating a Template

It is always considered best practice to work with a template. The first step is
to create a template for the LLD rules.  

Navigate to **Data collection**, select **Templates**, and click **Create template**
in the upper-right corner.  

Fill in the required information, specifying at least a **template name** and 
the **template group** it belongs to.

![lld user template](template-lld-users.png)

Once the template is created click on `Discovery` in the template between `Dashboards`
and `Web`. In the upper right corner of the screen you see now a button `create discovery rule`.

We will nog create our discovery rule that will import the `JSON` from our script.
Click on the button.

Fill in the needed information like on the screenshot :

![discovery rule](template-discovery-rule.png)

### Creating a Template for LLD Rules  

- **Type**: Set to **Zabbix agent**, as the agent is configured to work in passive
  mode. If the agent is properly configured for active mode, **Zabbix agent (active)**
  can be used instead. Passive mode allows polling information from the script.  
- **Key**: This key acts as a reference sent to the agent, instructing it on which
  script to execute.  
- **Update Interval**: Determines how often Zabbix executes the script. For detecting
  newly created users, an interval of **one hour** is a reasonable setting.


???+ note
    If you put the update interval for the discovery rule too frequent like every
    minute, then this will have a negative impact on the performance. In our case
    it's a small JSON file but most of the time it will contain much more data.

Once everything is filled in we can save the template.

Login to your console on the host that you would like to monitor and go to the
following path. 

!!! info ""
    ``` yaml
    cd `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent2.d/`
    or in case you are using Agent 1
    cd `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/`
    ```
### Creating the User Parameter Configuration  

The next step is to create the **userparameter-users.conf** file in this directory.
This file will define the reference key **users.discovery** from the LLD rule and
map it to the corresponding script. By doing this, Zabbix can associate the item
key with the correct script execution.

!!! info ""
    ``` yaml
    vi userparameter-users.conf
    ```
Add the following line in the config file and save it.

!!! info ""
    ```
    UserParameter=users.discovery,/usr/bin/users-discovery.sh
    ```

???+ note
    When you add a new `UserParameter` to the agent we need to restart the agent
    to pick up the new config or use the config option `-R userparameter_reload`
    on our agent this will apply the new configuration but only works on UserParameters
    not on other changes in the agent configuration.

### Saving the Template and Preparing the Monitored Host  

After entering all the required details, save the template to apply the configuration.  
Next, access the console of the host you want to monitor and navigate to the following
directory.


???+ note
    Zabbix agent has a new option since 6.0, `userparameter_reload`. This allows
    us to reload the config for the userparameters and makes a restart of the agent
    not necessary.

### Testing the Configuration  

With the setup complete, it is time to perform some tests.  

1. Navigate to **Data collection** and select **Hosts**.  
2. Link the newly created template to the appropriate host in the Zabbix frontend.  
3. Once the template is linked, go to the **Discovery** section.  
4. Click on the discovery rule created earlier, **Active users**.  
5. At the bottom of the screen, locate the **Test** button and click on it.  
6. In the popup window, press **Get value and test**.  

If everything is configured correctly, Zabbix will retrieve the expected value and
store it in the database.

![lld-test](lld-discovery-test.png)

If all went well you should have received some data back in JSON like you see here, 
depending on the number of users you made and what name you gave them.

!!! info ""
    ``` json
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "{#USERNAME}": "root",
          "{#ACTIVE}": "yes"
        },
        {
          "{#USERNAME}": "brian",
          "{#ACTIVE}": "no"
        },
        {
          "{#USERNAME}": "sven",
          "{#ACTIVE}": "no"
        },
        {
          "{#USERNAME}": "cartman",
          "{#ACTIVE}": "no"
        },
        {
          "{#USERNAME}": "kenny",
          "{#ACTIVE}": "no"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### Creating prototype items.

With our Low-Level Discovery (LLD) rule in place, we are ready to create our LLD
item prototype. Follow these steps to configure the item prototype correctly:

1. **Navigating to Item Prototype Configuration**
   - Open your template in Zabbix.
   - Click on the **Discovery** tab.
   - Navigate to **Item Prototypes**.
   - Click on **Create Item Prototype** in the upper-right corner.

2. **Configuring the Item Prototype**
   Several key fields must be completed for the prototype to function correctly:
   
   - **Name:**
     - Use the macro `{#USERNAME}` to create dynamically generated item names.
     - Example: `User {#USERNAME} login status`.

   - **Type:**
     - Select `Zabbix agent` as the item type to facilitate testing.

   - **Key:**
     - The item key must be unique.
     - Utilize macros to ensure a unique key for each item instance.

   - **Type of Information:**
     - Defines the format of the received data.
     - Since our script returns `0` or `1`, set this to `Numeric`.

   - **Update Interval:**
     - Determines how frequently the item is checked.
     - A reasonable interval for checking user online status is `1m` (one minute).

With these configurations, your LLD item prototype is ready for deployment.

  ![create lld item](lld-item-create.png)

### Configuring the Agent to Listen for LLD Items

Our LLD item will retrieve data from the key custom.user[{#USERNAME}], so the next
step is to configure the agent to listen for this key.

- Edit the `userparameter-users.conf` file that was created earlier on the `Zabbix agent`.
- Add the following line to the configuration file:
!!! info ""
    ```
    UserParameter=custom.user[*],who | grep -c "$1"
    ```
- This configuration ensures that the agent listens for requests using the
  `custom.user[{#USERNAME}]` key.
- The `{#USERNAME}` macro is dynamically replaced with usernames extracted from
  the discovery rule.

???+ note
    Important: After making changes to the configuration file, restart the `Zabbix agent`
    or reload the configuration to apply the new settings.

With these configurations in place, your LLD item prototype is fully set up and ready
for deployment.

### Testing our lld items

Before we put things in production we can of course test it. Press the `test` button
at the bottom. Fill in the needed information: 

- **Host address** : the IP or DNS name where we have our scripts configured on our agent.
- **Port** : the agent port. This should be 10050 unless you have changed it for some reason.
- **Macros** : map the macro with one of the user names you have configured on your system.

Press `Get value` and if all goes well Zabbix will return the value 1 or 0 depending
if the user is online or not.

![test lld item](lld-test-item.png)

Apply the template to your host and have a look at the latest data. Things should
slowly start to populate.

### Adding LLD triggers

Let's go back to our template to our `Discovery` and select `Trigger prototype`.
Click on the top right on `Create trigger prototype`.
Fill in the following fields:

- **Name** : `User {#USERNAME} is logged in` Again we want our information to be
  more dynamic so we make use of our macros in the name of our trigger.
- **Severity** : We select the severity level here. `Information` seems high enough.
- **Expression** : We want to get a notification if someone is online you can
  make use of the `Add` button or just copy : `last(/Discover users/custom.user[{#USERNAME}])=1`

![lld trigger](lld-trigger.png)

???+ note
    Copying the Expression will only work if you used the same name for the
    template and item key.

You can  now log in with a user that we created before or root and have a look at
our dashboard. A notification should popup soon to inform you that a user was
logged in.

![user root logged](lld-user-root-loggedin.png)

### Creating LLD overrides.

Having our notifications when users log in on our systems is a nice security feature
but i'm more worried when a user logs in with root then when for example Brian
logs in. When root logs in I would like to get the alert `High` instead of `Information`.

This is possible in Zabbix when we make use of overrides. Overrides allow us to
change the behaviour of our triggers under certain conditions.

Go to the template to the discovery rule `Active users`. Click on the tab `Overrides`.
Press on the button `Add` and fill in the needed information.

- **Name** : A useful name for our override in our case we call it `high severity for user root`.
- **Filters** : Here we filter for certain information that we find in our LLD 
  macros. In our case we look in the macro `{#USERNAME}` for the user `root`.

![lld override](lld-override.png)

- **Operation** : Here we define what needs to happen. We want to manipulate the
  trigger so select for object `Trigger prototype` and select that we want to modify
  the `Severity` and select `High`. This will modify the severity of our trigger
  and change it to `High` if the user that is detected is the user `root`.

![lld override operation ](lld-override-operation.png)

???+ note
    It can take a while before changes are applied to your host. Don't panic this
    is normal the discovery rule usually only updates every hour. If you like to
    force this just go to your discovery rule on the host, select it and press `Execute now`.

Once everything is changed you can login on your system with the user `root` and
one of the other users. As you will see both triggers will fire off but with
different severity levels.
