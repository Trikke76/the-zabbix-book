    This chapter explains how to effectively use Zabbix's built-in maintenance 
    periods to manage planned downtime without triggering false alerts. Zabbix
    allows you to schedule maintenance windows for hosts, host groups. This is 
    perfect for software updates, hardware replacements, or testing scenarios.
    You'll learn how to configure maintenance types (with or without data collection),
    define time periods, and apply them to specific targets. Using this feature
    correctly ensures your monitoring data remains clean, avoids alert noise,
    and helps teams stay focused during routine operations. Mastering maintenance
    tasks in Zabbix is essential for accurate alerting.
