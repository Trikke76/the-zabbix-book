# Zabbix maintenance

Maintaining a stable and efficient Zabbix environment requires more than just
monitoring external systems, it also involves taking care of Zabbix itself. This
chapter explores the key aspects of Zabbix maintenance, including setting up regular
backups to protect your data, using Zabbix's internal health checks to monitor
its own performance, and applying upgrades to stay current with new features and
security fixes. We'll also cover Zabbix's built-in maintenance mode, which allows
you to schedule downtime for hosts and services without triggering unnecessary
alerts. Together, these practices help ensure your monitoring system remains
reliable, resilient, and ready to scale.
