# Getting started with the Zabbix installation

We begin this chapter with a **deep dive into the Zabbix frontend**, the central
hub where all monitoring and configuration tasks come together. Alongside the
basic introduction to navigating the frontend, this chapter also covers **user
and group setup**, focusing on creating a secure and efficient user management
system.

We'll walk through setting up **internal authentication** with best practices
for security, including **dual-factor authentication**. For those needing
advanced integration, we'll explore options like **SAML, LDAP**, and other
external authentication methods.

This chapter strikes a balance between a straightforward overview “this is the
frontend” and a more in depth look at the **advanced choices** you can make to
enhance your system's security and manageability. Whether you're just getting
started or looking to implement robust security measures, there's something here
for everyone.

By the end, you'll be well equipped to navigate the Zabbix frontend with
confidence and set up a secure, scalable user management system tailored to your
organization's needs.
