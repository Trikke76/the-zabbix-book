# Proxies and the Web services component

Proxies are often regarded as an advanced topic in Zabbix, but in reality,
they are a fundamental part of many installations and one of the first components
we set up for numerous customers. In this chapter, we'll make proxies the third
subject we cover, encouraging you to consider them from the very beginning of your
Zabbix journey.

We'll start with a basic proxy setup, providing straightforward steps to get you
up and running quickly. Then, we'll take a deep dive into the mechanics of proxies
how they operate within the Zabbix ecosystem, their benefits, and the critical
role they play in distributing monitoring load and enhancing system scalability.

Understanding proxies from the start can significantly improve your architecture,
especially in distributed or large scale environments. Whether you're new to Zabbix
or looking to refine your existing setup, this chapter will offer valuable insights
into why proxies should be an integral part of your monitoring strategy from the start.

By the end, you'll not only know how to set up a basic proxy but also have a clear
understanding of their underlying workings and strategic advantages,
ensuring you make informed decisions as you scale your Zabbix installation.
