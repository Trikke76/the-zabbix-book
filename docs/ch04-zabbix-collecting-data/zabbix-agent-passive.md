# Zabbix Agent installation and Passive monitoring

At this point we are familiar with the Zabbix dataflow, how to create hosts and,
add interfaces and items to a host. As a system administrator or anyone else working
with Linux, Unix or Windows systems usually we jump right into installing the Zabbix
agent and monitoring with it. Using our previous steps however, we have laid the
groundwork for building a proper monitoring solution. We have prepared our systems
before monitoring, which is the most important part to avoid `Monitoring fatigue`
later on.

???+ note

    `Monitoring fatigue` and `Alert fatigue` are two terms heard in monitoring and observability.

    `Alert fatigue` happens in Zabbix when you configure too many (incorrect) triggers. When you flood your dashboards or even external media like Teams or Signal with too many alerts your users will not respond to them any longer.

     `Monitoring fatigue` happens in Zabbix when you misconfigure things like dashboards, items, host groups, tags and other internal systems that keep things structured. The result is that you or your co-workers do not want to use your own system any longer as it does not deliver the right information easily enough.

Now, we are ready to start monitoring an actual system.

## Agent basics

We have prepared an example setup in our Book LAB environment.

_4.14 Zabbix Agent passive hosts_

What we can see here is a setup you might see in any datacenter or office server
cabinet. We have a Zabbix server monitoring one Windows server and one Linux server
directly (or through a proxy). We call Zabbix a network monitoring solution as it
communicates over the network. In Zabbix we have two methods of communication.

- **Passive** Otherwise known as `polling`. We communicate from the Zabbix server
  (or proxy) towards the monitoring target. The monitoring target is listening
  on a port waiting for Zabbix to request data.
- **Active** Otherwise known as `trapping`. We communicate from the monitoring
  target towards the Zabbix server (or proxy). The Zabbix server is listening
  on a port waiting for the monitoring target to send data.

As you can imagine there is quite a big difference between these two methods of communication. Often times it depends on the protocol which method is preferred. For example SNMP traps are always an active type of check.

The Zabbix agent however can communicate in either `Active` or `Passive` mode. It can even do those simultaneously. Simultaneous communication can be useful when you want to use `Passive` mode for all communication, but still want to execute some items that are `Active` only. `Active` items can do everything `Passive` items can do however.

Before we can configure either though, we will have to install our Zabbix agent
first. When installing on Linux and Windows we have a choice between two different
agents, `Zabbix agent` and `Zabbix agent 2`. Both of these Zabbix agents are still
in active development and receive both major (LTS) and minor updates. The difference
between them is in Programming language and features.

|                      | Zabbix agent                     | Zabbix agent 2                          |

## Agent installation on Linux

Installation on Linux can be done in one of three ways. Through direct install
files like `.rpm` and `.deb`, by building from sources and through packages pulled
from the repository. Installation through the packages is preferred as this means
Zabbix agent will be updated when updating with commands like `dnf update` and
`apt upgrade`. Keep in mind, Zabbix agent is a piece of software just like any
other and as such news versions will contain security and bug fixes. Whatever
installation method you choose, keep your Zabbix agent up-to-date.

We will be using the packages on both RedHat-based and Ubuntu to install `Zabbix agent 2`.
To use the packages we will add the Zabbix repository first.

!!! info "add zabbix repository"

    Redhat

    ``` yaml
    rpm -Uvh https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.2/release/rocky/9/noarch/zabbix-release-latest-7.2.el9.noarch.rpm
    dnf clean all
    ```

    Ubuntu

    ``` yaml
    sudo wget https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.2/release/ubuntu/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_latest_7.2+ubuntu24.04_all.deb
    sudo dpkg -i zabbix-release_latest_7.2+ubuntu24.04_all.deb
    sudo apt update
    ```

After adding the repository, we should be able to install `Zabbix agent 2`.

!!! info "install Zabbix agent 2 package"

    Redhat

    ``` yaml
    dnf install zabbix-agent2
    ```

     Ubuntu

    ``` yaml
    sudo apt install zabbix-agent2
    ```

After installation make sure to start and enable the Zabbix agent.

!!! info "start Zabbix agent 2"

    Redhat

    ``` yaml
    systemctl start zabbix-agent2
    systemctl enable zabbix-agent2
    ```

Your agent is now installed under the `zabbix` user and ready to be configured.
On a Linux based system, by default we can find all of the Zabbix configuration
files in `/etc/zabbix/`. Specifically we want to edit `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent2.conf`.

## Agent installation on Windows

On Windows, we have two options to install our Zabbix agent. Through downloading
the `.exe` file and placing the configuration files in the right location or the
easy option. Downloading the `.msi` and going through the installation wizard.
Whichever method you prefer, you'll first have to navigate to the Zabbix download
page. We will be using the `.msi` in our example.

<https://www.zabbix.com/download_agents?os=Windows>

Here you will be presented with the choice to download either `Zabbix agent` or
`Zabbix agent 2`. Choose whichever one you would like to install, but by now we
recommend `Zabbix agent 2` as it is stable and includes more features.

Once downloaded, we can open the new `zabbix_agent2-x.x.x-windows-amd64-openssl.msi`
file and it will take us to the wizard window.

![Zabbix Agent Windows install step 1](ch04.15-windows-agent-install-step1.png){ align=center }

_4.15 Zabbix Agent Windows install step 1_

Step 1 is a simple welcome screen, nothing to do here except click on `Next`.

![Zabbix Agent Windows install step 1](ch04.16-windows-agent-install-step2.png){ align=center }

_4.15 Zabbix Agent Windows install step 2_

For step 2, make sure to read the `License Agreement` (or don't, we do not give legal advice). Then click `Next`.

![Zabbix Agent Windows install step 1](ch04.17-windows-agent-install-step3.png){ align=center }

_4.15 Zabbix Agent Windows install step 3_

For step 3 we have some more actions to execute. By default the Zabbix agent on Windows `.msi` installer includes `Zabbix sender` and `Zabbix get`. These are separate utilities that we do not need on every Windows server. I will not install them now, but we can always use the `.msi` to install them later. The Zabbix agent will function fine without them.

![Zabbix Agent Windows install step 1](ch04.18-windows-agent-install-step4.png){ align=center }

_4.15 Zabbix Agent Windows install step 4_

Step 4 is our most important step. Here we will already configure our Zabbix agent configuration file, straight from the `.msi` installer. Let's make sure to set the `Hostname`, `Zabbix server IP/DNS` (`192.168.46.6` in our case) and let's also set the `Server or proxy for active checks` parameter. As you can see we could also immediately configure encryption with the `Enable PSK` option, but we will do this later.

![Zabbix Agent Windows install step 1](ch04.19-windows-agent-install-step5.png){ align=center }

_4.15 Zabbix Agent Windows install step 5_

Now there is nothing left to do except press `Install` and our Zabbix agent will be both installed and configured.

## Agent installation on Unix

For Unix based systems, simply download the files on the Zabbix download page for either `AIX`, `FreeBSD`, `OpenBSD` or `Solaris`.

<https://www.zabbix.com/download_agents>

## Agent installation on MacOS

For MacOS systems, simply download the files on the Zabbix download page and run through the `.pkg` installer.

<https://www.zabbix.com/download_agents?os=macOS>

## Agent side configuration

Configuring the Zabbix agent is similar for all installations. Whether you are on `Linux`, `Unix`, `Windows` or `MacOS` you will always find the `../zabbix_agent2.conf` file. The parameters in this configuration file are mostly the same, regardless of the operating system.

For `Passive` Zabbix agent connections we have only one important parameters to configure out of the box. The `Server=` parameter. This parameter functions as an allowlist, where we can add IP addresses, IP ranges and DNS entries to a list. All of the entries in this `Server=` allowlist will be allowed to make a connection to the `Passive` Zabbix agent and collect data from it.

Edit your configuration file to include your Zabbix server (or proxy) IP address, IP range or DNS entry.

!!! info "edit the Server= parameter"

    ``` yaml
    Server=127.0.0.1,192.168.46.30
    ```

As you can see in the example, I've left `127.0.0.1`. Although not required, this can be useful in certain situations. Through the use of a comma `,` we have indicated that both `127.0.0.1` and `192.168.46.30` are allowed to connect. If you are running Zabbix server in HA mode or if you are using Proxy Groups, make sure to include all entries for the Zabbix components that need to connect.

After making changes to the Zabbix agent configuration file, make sure to restart the Windows service. On Linux systems use `sytemctl` to restart.

!!! info "restart Zabbix agent"

    ``` yaml
    systemctl restart zabbix-agent2
    ```

If you do not restart, the changes will not take effect.

## Zabbix side configuration

On the Zabbix server side we can now create a new host to monitor. Let's call it `zbx-agent-passive-rocky` or `zbx-agent-passive-windows` and let's add the interface.

![Zabbix Agent passive Linux host](ch04.20-passive-agent-linux-host.png){ align=left }

_4.20 Zabbix Agent passive Linux host_

For Windows it looks similar.

![Zabbix Agent passive Windows host](ch04.21-passive-agent-windows-host.png){ align=left }

_4.21 Zabbix Agent passive Windows host_

With the host added, correctly with an interface, we can now start monitoring. To do so, let's create one `Zabbix agent` item type as an example. For your new host `zbx-agent-passive-rocky` or `zbx-agent-passive-windows` in the Zabbix frontend, click on `Items` and then `Create item` in the top right corner.

Let's create an item `System hostname`, making sure that if we have more system items alphabetical sorting will group them together. For `Passive` Zabbix agent the type `Zabbix agent` is used and we have to specific an `Interface`. We will use the item key `system.hostname`.

![Zabbix Agent passive host item](ch04.22-passive-agent-item.png){ align=left }

_4.22 Zabbix Agent passive host item_

Do not forget to add the standard `Component` tag to the item to follow the best practise.

![Zabbix Agent passive host item tag](ch04.23-passive-agent-item-tag.png){ align=left }

_4.23 Zabbix Agent passive host item tag_

## Conclusion

Installing the Zabbix agent can be done with either `Zabbix agent` or `Zabbix agent 2`. By now `Zabbix agent 2` is recommended when available, but `Zabbix agent` is also still fully supported. Make sure to install the Zabbix agent through the most easily secured method and keep it updated.

Once installed, for `Passive` communication we will use the `Server=` parameter to keep our agent secured. We do not want everyone to be able to connect to this agent, even when there might still be a firewall or two in between.

Last but not least, keep `Active` versus `Passive` in mind. Depending on where the server is located, it might be preferred to open up ports through your firewall(s) incoming our outgoing. Usually we prefer `Active` communication, because it means we do not have to give a central server (Zabbix server and proxy) access to all our servers. But in specific cases `Passive` might be preferred.
