# Frontend Scripts

So, you're diving into the world of Zabbix frontend scripts, and you're in for 
a treat! These little powerhouses unlock a whole new level of flexibility within
your Zabbix environment. Imagine being able to trigger custom actions directly from
your Zabbix interface â€“ whether it's as an action operation responding to an alert,
a manual intervention on a host, or a targeted response to a specific event.

What's truly exciting is *where* you can weave these scripts into your daily Zabbix
workflow. Picture adding custom menu items right within your **Hosts**, **Problems**,
**Dashboards**, and even your **Maps** sections. This means the information and
tools you need are always at your fingertips.

Ultimately, frontend scripts empower you to extend Zabbix far beyond it's out-of-the-box
capabilities. They provide that crucial extra layer of customization, allowing you
to seamlessly integrate your own scripts and workflows directly into the Zabbix
frontend. Get ready to harness this power and tailor Zabbix precisely to your needs!

## Creating a frontend scripts

For this example, we'll work with a frontend script I developed that lets you put
hosts in maintenance mode. This script makes it possible to add a convenient option
in your GUI, allowing you to place hosts in maintenance with just a few clicks.
You can download the script from my GitHub repository :

[https://github.com/Trikke76/Zabbix/blob/master/maintenance/zabbix-maintenance.py](https://github.com/Trikke76/Zabbix/blob/master/maintenance/zabbix-maintenance.py)

!!! info "Download this script and place it in `/usr/bin/` "
    ```
    cd /usr/bin/
    sudo dnf install wget -y
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Trikke76/Zabbix/refs/heads/master/maintenance/zabbix-maintenance.py -P /usr/bin/
    chmod +x /usr/bin/zabbix-maintenance.py
    ```
Our Python script relies on an additional package that needs to be installed before
running. Make sure you have this dependency set up on your system before executing the script.

!!! info "install python3-requests"
    Red Hat
    ```
    dnf install python3-requests
    ```
    Ubuntu
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-requests
    ```

???+ note
    For the user you can use the user `Admin` or you can create a new user. but
    make sure this user has enough permissions to create a maintenance mode.
    It's best practice to create a dedicated user for this in production.

Starting with Zabbix 7.2, token-based authentication is required when working with
the API. Each user can create their own tokens, while the `Super admin` has management
privileges over all tokens.

To create a token for your Admin user:

- Navigate to `User settings`
- Select the `API tokens` sections

![User API](ch09-scripts-user.png)

*9.1 User API*

After selecting `API tokens` from the menu, you'll land on the `API tokens` page.
Look for the `Create API` token button in the top right corner and click it to
begin the creation process.

![Create API](ch09-create-api.png)

*9.2 Create API page*

A popup window will appear for creating your new API token. You'll need to provide
a unique `Name` for your token. While there's an option to set an expiration date,
we'll keep our token active indefinitely by leaving the time limit settings unchanged.

![New API token](ch09-new-api-token.png)

*9.3 Create new API token*

A confirmation popup will display your newly created API token, showing the `Auth token`
string generated by Zabbix. Be sure to copy or write down this token immediately,
as it will no longer be visible once you click `Close`. If you lose this token,
you'll need to delete it and create a new one. There's no way to retrieve or view
the token again through the interface.

![API Token Created](ch09-api-token-added.png)

*9.4 Added API token*

The next step is updating our script with the proper connection details. Edit the
script and modify the variables to include your Zabbix server's correct URL and
the token you just created. Pay attention to whether your server uses HTTP or HTTPS
protocol. Be sure the URL in your script matches your actual server configuration.

!!! info "Replace variables"
    ```
    sudo vi /usr/bin/zabbix-maintenance.py
    ```
    ```
    ZABBIX_API_URL = "https://zabbix-url.be/api_jsonrpc.php"
    ZABBIX_API_TOKEN = "API TOKEN"
    ```

Now that our script is properly configured, we need to set it up in the Zabbix
interface. From the main Zabbix menu, navigate to `Alerts` and then select `Scripts`
from the dropdown to access the scripts configuration area.

![Alerts scripts menu](ch09-Alert-scripts-menu.png)

*9.5 Scripts menu*

You should already see a few existing script  like `Ping`, `Traceroute`, .... that's
normal those where created with the installation of Zabbix. Press the button `Create scripts`
on the top right corner. A now form will popup where we will configure our maintenance
script. Fill out the following fields:

- *Name:* Create maintenance no data collection
- *Scope* : Manual host action
- *Menu path* : Maintenance
- *Type* : Script 
- *Execute on* : Zabbix proxy or server
- *Commands* : `/usr/bin/zabbix-maintenance.py create "{HOST.HOST}" {MANUALINPUT} no`

At the bottom we have a tab `Advanced configuration` Click on this and extra configuration
options will appear.

As you probably noticed we used in our `Command` the macro `{MANUALINPUT}` this
will be used to gather information from a user prompt. This allows us to ask
the user to fill in the time he wants to place the host in maintenance.

- *Enable user input* : yes
- *Input prompt* : How many minutes do you want to place the host in maintenance ?
- *Input type* : String (A dropdown box can also be used in case you have a list of options)
- *Default string* : 60 (but we can use anything this will just be the default answer)
- *Input validation rule* : `(\d+)` (our regex in perl to only allow digits)
- *Enable confirmation* : yes
- *Confirmation text* : Are you sure ?

If everything went well you should end up with a similar looking page :

![Script form](ch09-script-form.png)

*9.6 Script form*

When your are ready press `Add` at the bottom of the form. Let's test our script
to see if it works.

### Testing the frontend script

In Zabbix go to the menu `Monitoring` => `Hosts` and click on the host `Zabbix server`
and from the `scripts` menu select `Maintenance` and click on the sub Menu
`Create maintenance no data collection`. You should see a popup asking you how 
many minutes you like to place the host in maintenance.

![Monitoring host](ch09-host-testing-script.png)

*9.7 Create maintenance*

When we click continue however we get a popup telling us that Zabbix cannot execute the script.

![error execute](ch09-error-execute-script.png)

*9.8 Error executing script*

This error is normal Zabbix has an option in the configuration file of the `Zabbix server`
and the proxy that blocks the execution of global scripts. 

We get a notification that `Zabbix` cannot execute the script. The config file
has an option to block global executions by default in the server or proxy config
activate the option "EnableGlobalScripts=1". Go to the `Zabbix server` configuration
file with you favourite editor and enable the parameter and restart the server service. 


If all goes well this time you will see a popup telling you it was successful this time.

![Maintenance ok](ch09-ok-execute-script.png)

*9.9 Maintenance successful*

When we look in our Zabbix menu under `Data collection` => `Maintenance` we can see
that a new maintenance was created for our host with the time we had specified.
This will allow us to create Maintenance windows for hosts from the frontend with
only a few clicks.

Even better we are now able to allow certain non `Admin` users to create `maintenance periods`
for hosts without the need to give special access rights or create special profiles.
We have in our config of our script the option to limit the use of this `frontend script`
to certain `Host groups` and `User groups`.

???+ Tip 
    You can now create the same script but add the option `yes` instead of `no`
    when it comes to data collection and you can also create a script to delete
    the maintenance period by just replacing `create` with `delete` and remove
    all options after "{HOST.HOST}". This way you are able to create `maintenance periods`
    and delete them when not needed anymore per host.
