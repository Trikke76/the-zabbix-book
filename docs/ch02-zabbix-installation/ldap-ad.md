# LDAP / AD

As any modern system Zabbix can perform users authentication using Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). In theory LDAP is very well defined open
protocol that should be vendor independent but its relative complexity plays a
role in every LDAP server implementation. Zabbix is known to work well with
Microsoft Active Directory and OpenLDAP server.

LDAP authentication can be configured in two modes:

- Users authentication
- Users authentication with users provisioning

## Users authentication mode

The process of the authenticating users follows this diagram.

![LDAP users authentication](ch02.3-ldap-auth-diagram.png){ align=center }

_2.3 LDAP users authentication_

As shown on the diagram a user that tries to log in must be pre-created in
Zabbix to be able to log in using LDAP. The database user records do not have
any fields "saying" that the user will be authenticated via LDAP, it's just
users' passwords stored in the database are ignored, instead, Zabbix goes to
a LDAP server to verify whether:

- user with a given username exists
- user provided the correct password

no other attributes configured for the user on the LDAP server side are taken
into account.

So when Zabbix is used by many users and groups, user management becomes not a
very trivial task as new people join different teams (or leave). This problem
is addressed by "users provisioning" and we'll cover this topic a bit later.
For now let's take a look at how to configure LDAP authentication.

## Configure LDAP

We believe that it is better to learn this topic by example so we'll be using
our own LDAP server that you can spin up in a container by executing:

```
# Install docker if you don't have it
# For Ubuntu
apt install docker-ce

# Start LDAP server container with pre-loaded data
docker run -p 3389:389 -p 6636:636 --name openldap-server --detach bgmot42/openldap-server:0.1.1
```

All users (including `ldap_search`) in this test LDAP server for simplicity
have the word `password` as their passwords.

Users `user1` and `user2` is a member of `zabbix-admins` LDAP group. User
`user3` is a member of `zabbix-users` LDAP group.

???+ Optional

    To visually see LDAP server data (and add your own configuration like users
    and groups) you can start this standard container
    `docker run -p 8081:80 -p 4443:443 --name phpldapadmin --hostname phpldapadmin\
    --link openldap-server:ldap-host --env PHPLDAPADMIN_LDAP_HOSTS=ldap-host\
    --detach osixia/phpldapadmin:0.9.0`
    Now you can access this LDAP server via https://<ip_address>:4443 (or any
    other port you configure to access this Docker container), click Login,
    enter “cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org” in Login DN field and “password” in
    Password field, click Authenticate. You should see the following structure
    of the LDAP server (picture shows ‘zabbix-admins’ group configuration):

    ![LDAP server data](ch02.4-ldap-ldap-server-data.png){ align=center }

    _2.4 LDAP server data_

Let's configure LDAP server settings in Zabbix. In Zabbix menu select
`Users | Authentication | LDAP settings`, then check the check-box
`Enable LDAP authentication` and click `Add` under `Servers` (change IP address
of your LDAP server and port number according to your set up):

![LDAP server settings in Zabbix](ch02.5-ldap-server-settings-in-zabbix.png){ align=center }

_2.5 LDAP server settings in Zabbix_

Following diagram can help you understand how to configure LDAP server in
Zabbix based on your LDAP server data structure:

![LDAP server to Zabbix](ch02.6-ldap-server-to-zabbix.png){ align=center }

_2.6 LDAP server to Zabbix_

“Special” _Distinguished Name_ (DN) _cn=ldap_search,dc=example,dc=org_ is used
for searching, i.e. Zabbix uses this DN to connect to LDAP server and of course
when you connect to LDAP server you need to be authenticated – this is why you
need to provide _Bind password_. This DN should have access to a sub-tree in
LDAP data hierarchy where all your users are configured. In our case all the
users configured “under” _ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org_, this DN is called base
DN and used by Zabbix as so to say “starting point” to start searching.

???+ Note

    technically it is possible to bind to LDAP server anonymously, without
    providing a password but this is a huge breach in security as the whole
    users sub-tree becomes available for anonymous (unauthenticated) search,
    i.e. effectively exposed to any LDAP client that can connect to LDAP server
    over TCP. The LDAP server we deployed previously in Docker container does
    not provide this functionality.

Click `Test` button and enter `user1` and `password` in the respective fields, the
test should be successful confirming Zabbix can authenticate users against LDAP
server.

???+ Note

    We can add multiple LDAP servers and use them for different `User groups`.

To test real users login using LDAP authentication we need to create user
groups and users in Zabbix. In Zabbix menu select `Users | User groups`. Make
sure `Zabbix administrators` group exists (we'll need it later) and create new
group `Zabbix users` by clicking `Create user group` button. Enter "Zabbix
users" in `Group name` field, select "LDAP" in `Frontend access` drop-down that
will make Zabbix to authenticate users belonging to this group against LDAP
server and in `LDAP server` drop-down select LDAP server we earlier configured
"Test LDAP server". Click `Add` button to create this User group:

![Add user group in zabbix](ch02.7-ldap-add-user-group-in-zabbix.png){ align=center }

_2.7 Add user group in zabbix_

Now we need to create our test user. In Zabbix menu select `Users | Users` and
click `Create user` button. Then enter "user3" in `Username` field. Select
"Zabbix users" in `Groups` field. What you enter in `Password` and `Password
(once again)` fields does not matter as Zabbix will not try to use this
password, instead it will go to LDAP server to authenticate this user since
it's a member of the User group that has authentication method `LDAP`, just
make sure you enter the same string in these two fields and it satisfied your
password strength policy defined in `Users | Authentication`.

![Add user in Zabbix](ch02.8-ldap-add-user-in-zabbix.png){ align=center }

_2.8 Add user in Zabbix_

Then click `Permissions` tab and select "User role" in `Role` field:

![Add user in Zabbix - permissions](ch02.9-ldap-add-user-in-zabbix-permissions.png){ align=center }

_2.9 Add user in Zabbix - permissions_

Click `Add` button to create the user.

We are ready to test our LDAP server authentication! Click `Sign out` in Zabbix
menu and login with "user3" as Username and "password" as `Password`, if you
carefully followed the steps above you should successfully login with User role
permissions.

Click `Sign out` again and login as Admin again to proceed.

## Just-in-Time user provisioning

Now let's talk about really cool feature Zabbix provides - "Just-in-Time user
provisioning (JIT) available since Zabbix 6.4.

This picture illustrates on high level how it works:
![LDAP JIT explained](ch02.10-ldap-jit-explained.png){ align=center }

_2.10 LDAP JIT explained_

Here when Zabbix gets a username and password from the Zabbix Login form it
goes to the LDAP server and gets all the information available for this user
including his/her LDAP groups membership and e-mail address. Obviously, it
gets all that only if the correct (from LDAP server perspective) username and
password were provided. Then Zabbix goes through pre-configured mapping that
defines users from which `LDAP group` goes to which `Zabbix user group`. If at
least one match is found then a `Zabbix user` is created in the Zabbix database
belonging to a `Zabbix user group` and having a `Zabbix user role` according to
configured “match”. So far sounds pretty simple, right? Now let’s go into
details about how all this should be configured.

In `Users | Authentication` we need to do two things:

- Set `Default authentication` to _LDAP_. When JIT is turned off then type of
  authentication is defined based on the _User group_ a user that tries to login
  belongs to. In case of JIT the user does not exist in Zabbix yet thus obviously
  does not belong to any _User group_ so _Default_ method authentication is used
  and we want it to be _LDAP_.

- Provide `Deprovisioned users group`. This group must be literally _disabled_
  otherwise you won't be able to select it here. This is the Zabbix user group
  where all _de-provisioned_ users will be put into so effectively will get
  disabled from accessing Zabbix.

  ![Default authentication](ch02.11-ldap-default-authentication.png){ align=center }

  _2.11 Default authentication_

  Click `Update` button`.

- Enable JIT provisioning check-box which obviously needs to be checked for this
  feature to work. It's done in our _Test LDAP server_ configuration - select
  `Users | Authentication | LDAP settings` and click on our server in `Servers`
  section. After enabling this check-box we'll see some other fields related to
  JIT to be filled in and what we put in there depends on the method we choose to
  perform JIT.

### Group configuration method “memberOf”

All users in our LDAP server have _memberOf_ attribute which defines what LDAP
groups every user belongs to, e.g. if we perform a LDAP query for _user1_ user
we’ll get that its _memberOf_ attribute has this value:

**memberOf**: cn=**zabbix-admins**,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=org

Note, that your real LDAP server can have totally different LDAP attribute that
provides users’ group membership, and of course, you can easily configure what
attribute to use when searching for user’s LDAP groups by putting it into `User
group membership attribute` field:

![LDAP groups mapping](ch02.12-ldap-groups-mapping.png){ align=center }

_2.12 LDAP groups mapping_

In the picture above we are telling Zabbix to use _memberOf_ attribute to
extract DN defining user’s group membership (in this case it is
_cn=zabbix-admins,out=Group,dc=example,dc=org_) and take only _cn_ attribute
from that DN (in this case it is _zabbix-admins_) to use in searching for a
match in User group mapping rules. Then we define as many mapping rules as we
want. In the picture above we have two rules:

- All users belonging to _zabbix-users_ LDAP group will be created in Zabbix as
  members of _Zabbix users group_ with _User_ role
- All users belonging to _zabbix-admins_ LDAP group will be created in Zabbix
  as members of _Zabbix administrators_ group with _Super admin_ role

### Group configuration method “groupOfNames”

There is another method of finding users’ group membership called
“groupOfNames” it is not as efficient as “memberOf” method but can provide much
more flexibility if needed. Here Zabbix is not querying LDAP server for a user
instead it is searching for LDAP groups based on a given criterion (filter).
It’s easier to explain with pictures depicting an example:

![LDAP server group of names](ch02.13-ldap-group-of-names.png){ align=center }

_2.13 LDAP server groupOfNames_

Firstly we define LDAP “sub-tree” where Zabbix will be searching for LDAP
groups – note _ou=Group,dc=example,dc=org_ in Group base DN field. Then in the
field `Group name attribute` field we what attribute to use when we search in
mapping rules (in this case we take _cn_, i.e. only _zabbix-admins_ from full
DN _cn=zabbix-admins,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=org_). Each LDAP group in our LDAP
server has _member_ attribute that has all users that belong to this LDAP group
(look at the right picture) so we put _member_ in `Group member attribute`
field. Each user’s DN will help us construct `Group filter` field. Now pay
attention: `Reference attribute` field defines what LDAP user’s attribute
Zabbix will use in the `Group filter`, i.e. _%{ref}_ will be replaced with the
value of this attribute (here we are talking about the user’s attributes – we
already authenticated this user, i.e. got all its attributes from LDAP server).
To sum up what I've said above Zabbix:

1. Authenticates the user with entered Username and Password against LDAP
   server getting all user’s LDAP attributes
2. Uses `Reference attribute` and `Group filter` fields to construct a filter
   (when user1 logs in the filter will be (_member=uid=user1,ou=Users,dc=example,
   dc=org_)
3. Performs LDAP query to get all LDAP groups with member attribute (configured
   in `Group member attribute` field) containing constructed in step 2) filter
4. Goes through all LDAP groups received in step 3) and picks `cn` attribute
   (configured in `Group name attribute` field) and finds a match in User group
   mapping rules

Looks a bit complicated but all you really need to know is the structure of
your LDAP data.

### Ready to test

Now when you login with _user1_ or _user2_ username then these users will be
created by Zabbix and put into _Zabbix administrators_ user group, when you
login with _user3_ username then this user will be created by Zabbix and put
into _Zabbix users_ user group:

![Test user1](ch02.14-ldap-jit-test-user1.png){ align=center }

_2.14 Test user1_

![Test user3](ch02.15-ldap-jit-test-user3.png){ align=center }

_2.15 Test user3_
