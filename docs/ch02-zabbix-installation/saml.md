# SAML

## Google

Integrating Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for authentication within
Zabbix presents a non-trivial configuration challenge. This process necessitates
meticulous management of cryptographic certificates and the precise definition
of attribute filters. Furthermore, the official Zabbix documentation, while
comprehensive, can initially appear terse.

### Initial Configuration: Certificate Generation

The foundational step in SAML integration involves the generation of a `private key`
and a corresponding X.509 certificate. These cryptographic assets are critical
for establishing a secure trust relationship between Zabbix and the Identity Provider
(IdP).

By default, Zabbix expects these files to reside within the `ui/conf/certs/`
directory. However, for environments requiring customized storage locations, the
zabbix.conf.php configuration file allows for the specification of alternative
paths.

Let's create our private key and certificate file.

```bash
cd /usr/share/zabbix/ui/conf/certs/
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout sp.key -x509 -days 365 -out sp.crt
```

Following the generation and placement of the Zabbix Service Provider (SP) certificates,
the next critical phase involves configuring the Identity Provider (IdP). In this
context, we will focus on Google Workspace as the IdP.

Retrieving the IdP Certificate (idp.crt) from Google Workspace:

1. **Access the Google Workspace Admin Console:** Log in to your Google Workspace
   administrator account.
2. **Navigate to Applications:** Within the admin console, locate and select the
   "Apps" section.
3. **Access Web and Mobile Apps:** Choose `Web and mobile apps` from the available
   options.
4. **Create a New Application:** Initiate the creation of a new application to
   facilitate SAML integration. This action will trigger Google Workspace to generate
   the necessary IdP certificate.

5. **Download the IdP Certificate:** Within the newly created application's settings,
   locate and download the idp.crt file. This certificate is crucial for establishing
   trust between Zabbix and Google Workspace.
6. **Placement of idp.crt:** Copy the downloaded `idp.crt` file to the same directory
   as the SP certificates in Zabbix, under `ui/conf/certs/`.

### SAML Attribute Mapping and Group Authorization

A key aspect of SAML configuration is the mapping of attributes between Google
Workspace and Zabbix. This mapping defines how user information is transferred
and interpreted.

**Attribute Mapping:**

- It is strongly recommended to map the Google Workspace "Primary Email" attribute
  to the Zabbix "Username" field. This ensures seamless user login using their
  Google Workspace email addresses.
- Furthermore, mapping relevant Google Workspace group attributes allows for granular
  control over Zabbix user access. For instance, specific Google Workspace groups
  can be authorized to access particular Zabbix resources or functionalities.

**Group Authorization:**

- Within the Google Workspace application settings, define the groups that are
  authorized to utilize SAML authentication with Zabbix.
- This configuration enables the administrator to control which users can use
  SAML to log into Zabbix.
- In Zabbix, you will also need to create matching user groups and configure
  the authentication to use those groups.

**Configuration Example (Conceptual):**

- Google Workspace Attribute: "Primary Email" -> Zabbix Attribute: "Username"
- Google Workspace Attribute: "Group Membership" -> Zabbix Attribute: "User Group"

This attribute mapping ensures that users can log in using their familiar Google
Workspace credentials and that their access privileges within Zabbix are determined
by their Google Workspace group memberships.

### Zabbix SAML Configuration

With the IdP certificate and attribute mappings established within Google Workspace,
the final step involves configuring Zabbix to complete the SAML integration.

**Accessing SAML Settings in Zabbix:**

- **Navigate to User Management:** Log in to the Zabbix web interface as an administrator.
- **Access Authentication Settings:** Go to "Users" -> "Authentication" in the
  left-hand menu.
- **Select SAML Settings:** Choose the "SAML settings" tab.

**Configuring SAML Parameters:**

Within the "SAML settings" tab, the following parameters must be configured:

- **IdP Entity ID:** This value uniquely identifies the Identity Provider
  (Google Workspace in this case). It can be retrieved from the Google Workspace
  SAML configuration metadata.
- **SSO Service URL:** This URL specifies the endpoint where Zabbix should send
  authentication requests to Google Workspace. This URL is also found within the
  Google Workspace SAML configuration metadata.
  - **Retrieving Metadata:** To obtain the IdP entity ID and SSO service URL, within
    the Google Workspace SAML application configuration, select the option to `Download
metadata`. This XML file contains the necessary values.
- **Username Attribute:** Set this to "username." This specifies the attribute
  within the SAML assertion that Zabbix should use to identify the user.
- **SP Entity ID:** This value uniquely identifies the Zabbix Service Provider.
  It should be a URL or URI that matches the Zabbix server's hostname.
- **Sign:** Select `Assertions`. This configures Zabbix to require that the SAML
  assertions from Google Workspace are digitally signed, ensuring their integrity.

Example Configuration (Conceptual)

- IdP entity ID: [https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=your_idp_id](https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=your_idp_id)
- SSO service URL: [https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp/SSO?idpid=your_idp_id&SAMLRequest=your_request](https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp/SSO?idpid=your_idp_id&SAMLRequest=your_request)
- Username attribute: username
- SP entity ID: https://your_zabbix_server/zabbix
- Sign: Assertions

**Additional Configuration Options:**

The Zabbix documentation provides a comprehensive overview of additional SAML
configuration options. Consult the official Zabbix documentation for advanced settings,
such as attribute mapping customization, session timeouts, and error handling configurations.

**Verification and Testing:**

After configuring the SAML settings, it is crucial to thoroughly test the integration.
Attempt to log in to Zabbix using your Google Workspace credentials. Verify that
user attributes are correctly mapped and that group-based access control is
functioning as expected.

**Troubleshooting:**

If authentication fails, review the Zabbix server logs and the Google Workspace
audit logs for potential error messages. Ensure that the certificate paths are
correct, the attribute mappings are accurate, and the network connectivity between
Zabbix and Google Workspace is stable.

### SAML Media Type mappings

After successfully configuring SAML authentication, the final step is to integrate
media type mappings directly within the SAML settings. This ensures that media
delivery is dynamically determined based on SAML attributes.

**Mapping Media Types within SAML Configuration:**

- **Navigate to SAML Settings:** In the Zabbix web interface, go to "Users" ->
  "Authentication" and select the "SAML settings" tab.
- **Locate Media Mapping Section:** Within the SAML settings, look for the section
  related to media type mapping. This section might be labeled "Media mappings"
  or similar.
- **Add Media Mapping:** Click "Add" to create a new media type mapping.
- **Select Media Type:** Choose the desired media type, such as "Gmail relay."
- **Specify Attribute:** In the attribute field, enter the SAML attribute that
  contains the user's email address (typically "username," aligning with the
  primary email attribute mapping).
- **Configure Active Period :** Specify the active period for this media type.
  This allows for time-based control of notifications.
- **Configure Severity Levels:** Configure the severity levels for which this
  media type should be used.

Example Configuration (Conceptual):

- Media Type: Gmail relay
- Attribute: username
- Active Period: 08:00-17:00 (Monday-Friday)
- Severity Levels: High, Disaster

Rationale:

By mapping media types directly within the SAML configuration, Zabbix can dynamically
determine the appropriate media delivery method based on the SAML attributes received
from the IdP. This eliminates the need for manual media configuration within individual
user profiles when SAML authentication is in use.

Key Considerations:

- Ensure that the SAML attribute used for media mapping accurately corresponds to
  the user's email address.
- Verify that the chosen media type is correctly configured within Zabbix.
- Consult the Zabbix documentation for specific information about the SAML media
  mapping functionality, as the exact configuration options may vary depending on
  the Zabbix version.

### Final Configuration: Frontend Configuration Adjustments

After configuring the SAML settings within the Zabbix backend and Google Workspace,
the final step involves adjusting the Zabbix frontend configuration. This ensures
that the frontend correctly handles SAML authentication requests.

Modifying `zabbix.conf.php`:

- **Locate Configuration File**: Access the Zabbix frontend configuration file,
  typically located at /etc/zabbix/web/zabbix.conf.php.

- **Edit Configuration:** Open the zabbix.conf.php file using a text editor with
  root or administrative privileges.

- **Configure SAML Settings:** Within the file, locate or add the following
  configuration directives:

`php
// Uncomment to override the default paths to SP private key, SP and IdP X.509 certificates,
// and to set extra settings.
$SSO['SP_KEY']                  = 'conf/certs/sp.key';
$SSO['SP_CERT']                 = 'conf/certs/sp.crt';
$SSO['IDP_CERT']                = 'conf/certs/idp.crt';
//$SSO['SETTINGS']              = [];
`
