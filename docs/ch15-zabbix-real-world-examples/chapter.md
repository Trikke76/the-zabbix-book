# Zabbix real world examples

In this book we have learned a lot about our Zabbix environment, but most of it is building the foundation to start doing it on your own. From time to time you will encounter an implementation in a Zabbix environment that uses out of the box thinking or is just so simple you can't believe you never thought of it.

This chapter aims to provide you a collection of interesting things people have built and things you absolutely have to know exist.
